}
\arguments{
\item{experiments}{A list of experiments obtained from a high-throughput screen. See *Details* for more information on the structure of each element}

\item{metric}{The metric returned to the user. Must be a named variable from the \code{Summary_Ouput} of the S3 BayeSyneRgy object.}

\item{save_raw}{logical; if TRUE, the raw bayesynergy object is saved for each individual experiment}

\item{save_plots}{logical; if TRUE, plots for each individual experiment is saved}

\item{path}{string; path for saving output and plot for each individual experiment.}

\item{parallel}{logical; if TRUE, parallel processing is utilized to run the screen}

\item{max_cores}{integer; the maximum number of cores to utilize for the parallel processing}

\item{type}{integer; the type of model used. Must be one of the following: 1 (Splines), 2 (GP with squared exponential kernel), 3 (GP with Mat√©rn kernel) or 4 (GP with rational quadratic kernel).}

\item{lower_asymptotes}{logical; if TRUE the model will estimate lower estimate of monotherapy curves.}

\item{nu}{numeric; the nu parameter for the Matern kernel. Must be one of {`0.5`,`1.5`,`2.5`}}

\item{method}{The method of estimation. Must be one of {`sampling`,`vb`} corresponding to full sampling, or variational Bayes.}

\item{control}{list; passed on to the stan sampler, e.g. for setting adapt_delta.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to `rstan::sampling` (e.g. iter, chains).}
}
\description{
The function \code{synergyscreen} allows the fitting of high-throughput drug combination screens through parallel processing
}
\details{
The elements of \strong{experiments} must themselves be lists with the following elements
\tabular{ll}{
y: \tab matrix of viability scores \cr
y: \tab matrix of concentrations \cr
drug_names: \tab vector of drug names in the experiment \cr
experiment_ID: \tab string denoting the unique experiment ID, e.g. cell line name.
}
